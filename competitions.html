                    One of my hobbies is to take part in programming competitions. Not only do you get to compete against other people but it is a very good learning experience. Below are a number of competitions I attended and some information about the task(s) to be completed.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Google Hash Code 2016
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In February 2016, Bernard Hili, Jacob Falzon, Leon Degiorgio and myself decided to take part in Google's international programming competition; Hash Code 2016.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem at hand was an optimisation problem similar to the travelling salesman problem. Given a number of drones D, a number of warehouses W, an number of orders O and a number of moves M, D drones had to pick up items from the warehouses W for all O orders and deliver them to people's houses in a maximum of M moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem was quite challenging given that there were many variables to consider and less than 4 hours were given to solve the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We opted to solve the problem using Java and creating a number of classes to represent the main characters i.e. drones, warehouses etc. The problem was that the 4 hours were not enough to provide a fully working solution for submission. In fact, no local teams managed to submit a solution within the alloted time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we didn't manage to solve the problem in the alloted time, it was still a very good learning process even more so since after the deadline we were told that the problem would have been much simpler if we user golang, a programming language made by google specifically for simulation. Nobody was aware of this new language but thanks to this competition we got to know more about this new technology. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Game of Codes 2015 Student's Section
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The task assigned was to recreate an image using a pre-defined number of squares from a set of images provided, similar to creating a collage. As per the Game of Codes rule, the problem had to be tackled in 48 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My team mates (Malcolm Camilleri, Jacob Falzon and Leon Degiorgio) along with myself decided to use MatLAB since we had previous experience with image manipulation using MatLAB. The initial approach was to find objects in the image using edge detection techniques, deciding on n objects depending on size (largest first), transforming the objects into squares, then finding the best fit square from the given images.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent the first 24 hours perfecting this method but we couldn't get it to work since we couldn't feed the defined edges back into the program. Therefore, we decided to scrap the idea and implement the solution in the final 24 hours. The new approach simply divided the image in the next square number (larger than n) then finding a square with the closest color from the composition images provided. Finally, the method would iterate over the squares and join the most similar squares so exactly n squares are achieved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this approach was not optimal, it was a good approximation of the problem. In fact, one of the main lessons learnt from this competition was to not over engineer the problem so much that the solution can not be achieved within the time alloted. Another lesson learnt is that although you might have previous knowledge using a specific language or framework, that is not always the best solution. One of the problems encountered is that the execution time was greater than the 60 seconds permitted. This greatly influenced our performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, we managed to finish joint 3rd in the student's section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The source code of the solution can be found <a href='http://github.com/nikmic94/GameOfCodes2015'>here</a>.
