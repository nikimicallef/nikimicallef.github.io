                    Welcome to nikimicallef.com!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This website was created by me, Niki Micallef, to showcase myself both as a person and as an academic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During summer 2015, I was unable to find a job that interested me, therefore, instead of laying around all summer, I decided I wanted to do something where I could learn and better myself. This is how nikimicallef.com was born. I started by learning HTML and CSS from scratch, since I had no previous knowledge
                    of web development. This was obviously quite a jump from the functional/imperative languages I learnt up to now. Nonetheless, using tutorials found on codecademy.com and theodinproject.com, I managed to learn enough content to create this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I feel that the specifics of the website (content/design) are secondary. For me, this project was more for the learning experience. It was the first time that I had to learn something from scratch without the help of a teacher/tutor or someone who I can turn to for help.
                    For me, learning something to a degree where I had to create a product which will be used by the general public was also new, since until this point, I had only worked on school/university assignments. Creating something new in a short period of time was challenging, but with a bit of perseverance, I managed to finish the website, which I hope you will enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website has 3 main sections excluding the main page; About, Personal Projects and Résumé.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'About' section contains a brief description about, focusing on both the academic and personal sides of me as a person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'Personal Projects' section contains information about the projects I have worked on in my spare time, such as this website! I also provide a GitHub link for most of the projects. My full GitHub repository can be found by clicking the GitHub icon on the right side of the screen. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'Résumé' section contains a brief description of my education and work experience in bulleted format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you enjoy the website!
