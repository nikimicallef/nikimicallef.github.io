                    Bernard Hili, Daniel Cumbo and myself participated in the Robot Wars 2015 17kg competition.

                    The aim of robot wars is to create a fighting robot which will battle against the robots created by other participants. Your robot should try to immobilise the opposing robot using the weapons you created for your robot. All teams are in charge of creating their robot from scratch including both electrical/engineering along with the software side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After months creating and perfecting the robot, we ended up building a vertical crusher. The robot is made out of 2/3mm solid steel plates along with a 2mm frame. The robot is powered by two high RPM motors while the vertical crusher is powered by a high torque motor. APM 2.6 and Ardiuno microcontrollers were used to control the software side of the robot.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had the support of two local companies; <a href='http://www.goeke-group.com/en/company/goeke-technology-group/ibg-automation.html'>IBG Automation Malta</a> and <a href='http://www.fabian.com.mt/en/home.htm'>Fabian Enterprises</a>. We are very grateful towards our sponsors since we couldn't finish the project without their help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also created a video of the process which can be seen below.

                    The competition started very well. We managed to win the tug of war competition testament of the raw power and good traction of the robot. Unfortunately, things didn't go too well during the main competition. Although the robot was very well built, the robot was not receiving commands from the remote control due to conflicts with outer remote controls. In fact, the robot performed as expected when there was no other interference but it locked up after ~20 seconds if another remote control was switched on. This meant that we were only effective for ~20 seconds and the rest of the fight we were sitting ducks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We tried to switch remote controls but we didn't manage to get the robot running in time. This problem was very unfortunate and something we didn't expect since we were using 2.4GHz encrypted signals. We concluded that this was down to a faulty remote control or receiver.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, we managed to qualify from the group stage but lost the semi-final to the eventual winners. It is worth noting that although we were immobile for much of the competition, the robot suffered little to no damage. The only problems were small dents on the side plates of the robot. Internally everything was still untouched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we were not as successful as we expected to be we are still very happy with the process since it thought us a lot and put us in many new situations which we had never experienced previously.
