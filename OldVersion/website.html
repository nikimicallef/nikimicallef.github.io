                    The idea of creating my personal website started in 2013, when the website <a href='http://www.adampacitti.com/employadam/index.html'>employadam.com</a> became viral. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adam Pacitti, a fresh graduate from the University of Winchester, was struggling to find a stable job. Therefore, he created a website and then advertised this new website on a billboard. This marketing campaign helped him get enough recognition to get employed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Much like Adam, even I wanted my personal online space where I can showcase myself. The aim of the website is not really to make myself employable but rather to create something targeted for the general public while learning something new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website represents my first ever personal project. I wanted to create a very basic website using simple web design techniques and using only HTML and CSS. I had no previous knowledge of either languages so I had to start web design from scratch. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I had no previous HTML/CSS experience, I started by doing the <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn'>codecademy</a> tutorials for HTML and CSS followed by a number of courses including 'Make a Website' and 'Make a Website Projects.' I also followed most of <a href='http://www.theodinproject.com/'>The Odin Project</a> to strengthen the previously learned techniques. Although I did learn some JavaScript, I decided to keep this project as simple as possible and stay away from JavaScript. Future revisions of the website might contain some elements of JavaScript. Personally, I feel that I lack the creative edge, thus I needed some inspiration for the colour scheme and the general format of the website. I looked up a number of websites similar to mine to get a sense of how to structure my website. The design was inspired by the example given in the HTML & CSS course given on <a href='http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/'>shayhowe.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from the challenges encountered using HTML and CSS, I also had to learn the process of buying a domain and hosting the actual website. This process, although considered trivial, was new to me since I had never created/hosted my own website before.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I am quite happy with the end product. The fact that I managed to start a project and finish it is an accomplishment in itself, since this was the first project I actually finished. As time goes by, I will update this website when necessary.
